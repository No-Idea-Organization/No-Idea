The Secret of Monkey Island,8/10,1990,"The Secret of Monkey Island is a 2D adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist Guybrush Threepwood through the game's world and interacts with the environment by selecting from twelve verb commands (nine in newer versions) such as ""talk to"" for communicating with characters and ""pick up"" for collecting items between commands and the world's objects in order to successfully solve puzzles and thus progress in the game. While conversing with other characters, the player may choose between topics for discussion that are listed in a dialog tree; the game is one of the first to incorporate such a system. The in-game action is frequently interrupted by cutscenes. Like other LucasArts adventure games, The Secret of Monkey Island features a design philosophy that makes the player character's death nearly impossible (Guybrush does drown if he stays underwater for more than ten minutes)."

The tank also has a cloaking device that, when triggered, would render it invisible to enemies for about a minute.

When the player character touches the bubble or the timer reaches zero, they die. Monsters can also pop bubbles. Although the arcade game and the PlayStation version included in Buster Bros.

Tactic ,6/10,1990,"Tactic is a falling block puzzle as popularised by the game Tetris. Unlike that game, all of the blocks are the same size but are a number of different colours (and on systems that cannot display enough colours, different shapes).

They can be entered individually, or in a marathon-style championship that links all five competitions together."
