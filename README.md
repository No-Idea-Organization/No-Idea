<h2>About the project</h2>

<p>
## Inspiration
We first wanted 

## What it does
It's a web scraper for retro games that allows you to view their rating, year published, type of game, and more.

## How we built it
We approached building this as a Full-Stack Application where our frontend used ReactJs, backend used Java, and spring boot for our Rest Api.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a lot of time constraints as well as issues dealing with what tasks needed to be completed in order to stay on track. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Able to work in fast-paced environment, worked to collaborate with developers with different mindsets, and having the majority of the project's aspects work.

## What we learned
Learned more about ReactJS, how to use git commands, the process of pushing and pulling code, and broadened our understanding of Rest Api. 

## What's next for No Idea's Retro Games Web Scraper 
Fix bugs, add new features such as advance search, and better visual appeasement.
